# üöó Used Car Sales ‚Äì Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Analysis

This repository contains statistical analysis performed on a cleaned dataset of used car sales, with a focus on applying **hypothesis testing techniques** to draw actionable insights about the automotive resale market.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- **`car_sales_cleaned.csv`**: Contains detailed records of used cars including:
  - `make` (car brand)
  - `sellingprice` (resale price)
  - `body` (body type)
  - `transmission` (manual/automatic)
  - `color`, `year`, `condition`, `state`, etc.

## üéØ Objectives

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ One-Sample t-Test
> **Hypothesis**: The average resale price of Toyota cars is ‚Çπ12,400.
- Method: One-sample t-test
- Tool: `scipy.stats.ttest_1samp`
- Result: Determines whether the observed Toyota resale prices significantly differ from the expected market average.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Way ANOVA
> **Goal**: Analyze the impact of `body type`, `transmission`, and their interaction on black car resale prices.
- Method: Two-Way ANOVA
- Tool: `statsmodels.formula.api.ols`
- Sample: Random sample of 5000 black-colored cars
- Preprocessing: Rare body types grouped as 'Other'; filtered combinations with < 10 entries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chi-Square Test of Independence
> **Question**: Is the color distribution of Toyota cars significantly different from that of all cars?
- Method: Chi-square test
- Tool: `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency`
- Approach: Builds a contingency table between `color` and `make`

## üìä Results Summary

| Test                     | Outcome                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One-Sample t-Test**    | ‚ùå **Fail to reject null hypothesis**: Toyota resale price is **not significantly different** from ‚Çπ12,400 |
| **Two-Way ANOVA**        | ‚úÖ **Significant effects**: Body type, transmission, and their interaction all significantly impact resale price of black cars |
| **Chi-Square Test**      | ‚úÖ **Reject null hypothesis**: Toyota's color distribution is **significantly different** from the overall market |
